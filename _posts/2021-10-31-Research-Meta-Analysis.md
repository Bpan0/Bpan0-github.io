[Job Automation Risks in 2021](https://research.com/careers/job-automation-risks) 

The topic of this scientific article is how the future of employment will be affected by computerization. When reading this article, the Oxford Study Future of Employment Findings shows the top 10 jobs that are most likely to be replaced as well as the top 10 least most likely jobs to be replaced by computerization. This in and of its self is a major flaw because it limits it to these specific jobs that may or may not affect society more strongly than other jobs. What's nice about  this study is that the person doing it is collecting it from both the Oxford Study Future of Employment as well as other sources. However, the other soruce bases it off of only two studies. Ideally, more would be better because it  would enact a more accturate portrayal. Another form of exclusion might be the discrimination against the human counterpartâ€™s demographic variables. In addition to studies, the article talks about 4 more things: Social intelligence, Creative intelligence, Dexterity of human senses and Positive Impact of Automation on Employment. What's good about this article is that not only does it include the negative side effects of what computerized jobs are coming to be but also bring the positive side which allows the viewer to not think of it only as a negative connotation. The study was funded by no means as this person had taken the information from other existing sources. This study doesn't have much effect but will show the outcome of whiat might happen in the future.
