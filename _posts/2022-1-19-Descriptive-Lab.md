## Descriptive Lab on Worldwide Covid Cases
Collaborators: Darson Chen, Mr. Lee


For this Lab, I worked on a dataset about the COVID 19 cases for each country in the world. The data is split up into a few categories. Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered and Active. When looking at the dataset, I thought of a few questions that I wanted to answer. Of all countries, which country has the highest perscent of death to confirm ratio. Of all countries, which countries have the highest recovey to confirmed ratio. And finally, of all countries, which has the highest recovered to death ratio. 

While gathering this data, I ran into the problem that there are too many countries listed so I limited it to the top 5 countries. Looking at the data, I came to a realization that the countries that countries that actively tests for covid have a much higher recovery rate but also have the largest casualty rate. Throughout the lab, I included multiple different graphs to show a comparison between the countries. Some countries like singapore had the highest recovery to mortality rate which shows that it had a very good lockdown protocol to keep people quarentined and safe. On the contrast, we see that places like Yemen has the highest confirmed to death casualty rate ratio, showing that they really struggled with covid and its repercussions. We can also see that some countries like Liechtenstein and Greenland which are considerably small being the highest recovery rate. This is probably because it is extremely small and the spread of the pandemic isn't a big of a problem. 

Some limitations that I found in my dataset are that many of the countries listed either don't take covid tests or don't report them to the census. Because of this, when finding the data for Recovery vs. Mortality ratio, it would show 0 deaths and an infinite recovery rate. Another limitation that I found was that in addition to countries not reporting their information, is that this data is over a long time and doesn't show specific ups and downs of each country.
